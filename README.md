It is not just a chatbot - it is a supportive friend It offers a safe and non-judgmental space for individuals to express their feelings and thoughts. 
It actively listens, understands, and provides motivation and encouragement to help people face their challenges with courage.<br />
It is like your own baymax - but without the body. It is still able to provide you with warmth nonetheless!
